      Hello! My name is Luis and
      <span style="color:#63FFDA">I'm a trader turned web developer</span>. After almost 4 years in finance, I
      couldn't help but see the huge impact technology had in all sectors across the economy. I decided it was time to
      make a change, so I quit my job and enrolled in a programming course in Brussels to learn how to code. 450h of
      hands-on experience later, I was eager and ready to start my career as a developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast forward a bit and I've had the privilege of working at
      <span style="color:#63FFDA">the very same coding school I went to, a start-up and another coding school in
        Dublin</span>. Other than that, I'm always working on side projects.
    </p>
    <p>Some technologies that I've worked with:</p>
    <ul class="skill-set">
      <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
      <li>Ruby</li>
      <li>React</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>HTML/ CSS</li>
    </ul>
